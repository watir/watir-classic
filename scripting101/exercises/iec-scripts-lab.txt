h2=. Lab 3: Writing Scripts

Now that you've used IRB to drive Internet Explorer, it is time to
create a script. Actually, you'll create several. Create each script
using Scite, the ruby editor. You may wish to try the commands in IRB
first, to make sure they are right.

There are three ways to run scripts: 

# The simplest method is to type F5 while editing the script in
  Scite. This will save the file and then execute it. The output will
  be displayed in a side window.

# A second method is to run a script from the system command
  line. Type "ruby script-name.rb" at the DOS prompt. (Actually, just 
  "script-name.rb" usually works too.) This is the most
  reliable method. Use it you are having trouble using F5 in Scite.

# A third method is to load the script into IRB. Type "load
  'script-name.rb'" at the IRB prompt. The advantage of this method is
  that you can interact with the IE Controller
  after the script has run, using the Watir::IE.attach() method. This 
  gives you a method for debugging your
  scripts.

When you automate tests, you need to be able to repeat tests much more
precisely than when you are testing manually. The
'ensure_no_user_data' method has been specifically provided as a
testability feature for timeclock. You may find it useful.

Create and execute scripts for each of the following procedures. As you 
complete each script, demonstrate it to your instructors.

#    *Start The Day.* Log in and navigate to the main time
     clock page, and then start the day.

#    *Start, Stop and Pause.* Start, stop, pause, and
      restart a job. Choose a suitable order for these actions.

#    *Job Switching.* Creates two jobs and then switch
      back and forth between them every few seconds.
