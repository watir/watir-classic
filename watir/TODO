Things that need to be addressed before committing this code.

1. hwnd_modal === 
2. logic in hwnd() -- should set @hwnd, no?
3. need tests to verify click_no_wait, etc work with other containers
4. need tests to verify text(), html() work with frames and other containers (suspect this is broken)
5. remove duplication between attach_modal and modal_dialog
6. remove :title option
7. fix modal_dailog_test errors
8. make enabled_popup private
9. do we really want to attach an error checker to frames?
10. revert globals to class variables
11. click_no_wait appears to be broken
12. enabled_popup should be private
