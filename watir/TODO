Things that need to be addressed before committing this code.

1. hwnd_modal === 
	Looks like it was (is) a bug in WET as there's no way hwnd_modal can === hwnd().  changed to ==

2. logic in hwnd() -- should set @hwnd, no?
	No, hwnd is found in the ie COM object via ie.HWND or set in ModalDialog.  Anywhere else the method
	will follow up the inheritance path.

3. need tests to verify click_no_wait, etc work with other containers

4. need tests to verify text(), html() work with frames and other containers (suspect this is broken)
	It was.  Simple fix was to move html() and text() to Container instead of having it in IE.

5. remove duplication between attach_modal and modal_dialog
	Should I just remove attach_modal?  Right now it doesn't conflict so we *could* support them both.

6. remove :title option
	I disagree.  No harm in leaving :title option in modal_dialog, and it works fine.  (See modal_dialog_tests.rb)

7. fix modal_dailog_test errors
	Only error is the test that tries to use a regexp for title, which isn't implemented yet.

8. make enabled_popup private
	I disagree.  This is a VERY useful public function.  In scraping I use the following series:
	A.	Call click_no_wait at the end of a page.
	B.	Call enabled_popups() to see if *any* popup occurs (modal, javascript or security)
	C.	Call the proper method to attach to and clear the popup, depending on the page.

9. do we really want to attach an error checker to frames?
	I'm not sure why this is here?  It's not a part of implementing modal dialog support

10. revert globals to class variables
	Since the functions are called from within different classes they need to be global

11. click_no_wait appears to be broken
	Fixed.  Needed to catch an exception in find_window for windows with no HWND function.


Outside modal_dialog:

1. There aren't any tests to click on a table cell (ie.cell(:text, /click here/).click)

2. ie.tables.show only shows index and id, and misses an existing id on table1.html
	ie.show_tables shows index, id, # rows, # columns

3. No tests for table(:class_name, //)
