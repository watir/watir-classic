<H3>Pragmatic Project Automation</H3>
<P><EM>Pragmatic Project Automation</EM> shows you how to improve the 
consistency and repeatability of your project's procedures using automation to 
reduce risk and errors. </P>
<P>Simply put, we're going to put this thing called a computer to work for you 
doing the mundane (but important) project stuff. That means you'll have more 
time and energy to do the really exciting---and difficult---stuff, like writing 
quality code. </P><SPAN class=catalogprice>$29.95</SPAN> <A class=addtocart

<H3>Pragmatic Version Control</H3>
<P>This book is a recipe-based approach to using Subversion that will get you up 
and running quickly---and correctly. All projects need version control: it's a 
foundational piece of any project's infrastructure. Yet half of all project 
teams in the U.S. don't use any version control at all. Many others don't use it 
well, and end up experiencing time-consuming problems. </P><SPAN

<H3>Pragmatic Unit Testing (C#)</H3>
<P>Pragmatic programmers use feedback to drive their development and personal 
processes. The most valuable feedback you can get while coding comes from unit 
testing. </P>
<P>Without good tests in place, coding can become a frustrating game of 
"whack-a-mole." That's the carnival game where the player strikes at a 
mechanical mole; it retreats and another mole pops up on the opposite side of 
the field. The moles pop up and down so fast that you end up flailing your 
mallet helplessly as the moles continue to pop up where you least expect them.
