Compiling win32ole (Ruby 1.8.7 +)
==================================

(1) Download and install the appropriate version of Ruby: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
(2) Download and install the Ruby DevKit: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
(3) Check out the source code: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/ruby-core/
(4) Go to the directory where you installded the DevKit and run devkitvars.bat
(5) Go into the ruby source tree: ruby/etc/win32ole
(6) Make sure you can build without the patch
  (a) Run: 'ruby extconf.rb'
  (b) Run: 'make'
  (c) Presuming you didn't encounter any errors, this will create: win32ole.so
  (d) Run: 'make clean'
(7) Apply the win32ole.patch (if a lot has changed it might not go cleanly and require some manual steps)
(8) Re-run through step (6) now that the code has been patched.
  (a) Pay close attention to any warnings or errors. (the interfaces or  parameters may have changed slightly)
  (b) Create a patch if the original patch didn't go cleanly
  (c) copy the .so (and patch if necessary) into the watir source tree
