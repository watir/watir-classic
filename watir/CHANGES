To install this:

  "gem update --system"
  "gem install watir"

Installer Fix

This update fixes an installer problem in Watir 1.5.5 that affected some users. 
If you installed 1.5.5 without error, there is no reason to get this update.

== Watir 1.5.5.

New Features

* Multiple attributes can now be specified for these elements:
  li, ul, map, area, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. (This was claimed to work earlier, 
  but never did.)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-196

Bug Fixes

* Statements such at ie.table().row() now work (no longer private). 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-117
* Fixed bug with images method when used with anything but ie. (Paul Rogers)
  E.g. ie.div().images. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-211
* Fixed intermittent bug with ie.file_field().set. (Tomislav Car)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-210
* When installing Watir 1.5.4 you could get extra, confusing
  questions. This shouldn't happen anymore.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-209
* Improved error message when element is not found using multiple attributes.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-181
* Made examples and unit tests somewhat better examples: removed unnecessary
  "include Watir" statements; started using "browser" instead of "$ie"; use
  new methods 'goto_page' and 'uses_page' (this last improves performance of 
  unit tests). 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-159
* Moved brittle unit test that was causing cascading failures; renamed another
  that was causing a namespace collision.  
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-92

== Version 1.5.4

New Features

* Add new speed, :zippy. This is like fast, but, in effect, it does a TextField#value= instead of a TextField#set. If you have specific text fields that you never want this to happen to, use ie.text_field(:how, what).requires_typing.set instead.
  http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/changelog/watir/?cs=1295
* Add support for Chinese input as supplied by Vincent Xu. 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-71.

Bug Fixes

* Add dependency on windows-pr 0.6.6, which seems to be necessary on Vista.
* Fix for bug in IE.close_others provided by Paul Taylor.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-194
* Fix for error when using verify_equal with ci_reporter, provided by Marcog.
  http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/changelog/watir/?cs=1301

== Version 1.5.3

Bug fixes and minor cleanup.

* Fix text areas bugs.
* Fix warning messages caused by redefined constants.
* Break out watir.rb into multiple files.
* Fix [WTR-90] error when running tests when installing gem.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-90
* Fix tests.
* Update documentation.

Major Changes in 1.5.2
    Support for IE's Modal Dialogs. 
      showModalDialog() 
    Any method can be used to specify an element (:text, :class, etc.). 
      ie.button(:class,'Button Menu').click
      ie.div(:text, 'Type').text_field(:class, 'TextInput-input').set('my value')
      ie.button(:text, 'Save').click 
    One can now use multiple attributes to specify an element.
      ie.span(:class =>'Label', :text => 'Add new').click
      
Other Changes in 1.5.2
    * Migrated IE.new_process from watir/contrib and improved its reliability. We now recommend IE.new_process over IE.new as a way to avoid numerous errors detailed in http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-150.
    * Added IE.start_process. This works like IE.start, but uses the new_process mechanism to start IE.
    * Added IE.new_window and IE.start_window. This are synonyms for IE.new and IE.start.
    * Added dependency on the win32-process gem.
    * Added IE.each, which iterates through the various IE windows currently open.
    * Updated WindowHelper and watir/dialog to work with IE7
    * The wait method was completely rewritten. This should fix various errors seen in 1.5.1.1165 and 1.5.1.1158.
    * Removed the "spinner".
    * Fixed bug in Element#parent and updated unit test.
    * HTML value attributes are checked as strings before converting, updated unit tests.
    * Watir::wait_until clean up.
    * Fix for winclicker when installed in directory with spaces.
    * Rdoc changes and updates.
    * A workaround for frame access errors in the wait command, swallowing access denied errors and rethrowing if other WIN32OLERuntimeErrors show up.
    * Add support for "li" tag.
    * Fix for bug in element_by_xpath. http://www.mail-archive.com/wtr-general@rubyforge.org/msg06742.html
    * "Wait" method now is called recursively into nested frames. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-107
    * Rdocs now only include the core Watir library (not contrib).
    * Improve error reporting when IE#modal_dialog isn't found.
    * Add method "ModalDialog#exists?"
    * Add Watir::Win32.window_exists? method.
    * Fix for winclicker setComboBoxTest and setTextBoxText http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-124
    * Improved Support for IE7
        o Fix for IE7 on ie.exists? http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-123
        o Fix for IE7 with winclicker.
        o Fix for check_for_http_error in IE7. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-141
    *  Fix for IE7 on ie.exists? http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-123
    * Rubyw is now used in winclicker to bypass command line windows.
    * Autoit is registered before being used.
    * Watir now checks for the right version of Ruby before loading our customized Win32ole library.
    * ie.file_field has been fixed and unit test updated.
    * rdoc generation has been fixed.
    * page checker has been moved from the default behavior into contrib/page_checker.rb
    * Fix for intermittent crashes occuring when using Watir with Ruby version > 1.8.2.
    * Fix for http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-86
        This fix prevents the Watir-modified win32ole.so library (compiled against 1.8.2) from being used.
    * Added Element#parent
    * Add new methods Element#after? and Element#before?
    * Added support for relative specifiers. E.g.:
        link = $ie.link(:class => 'addtocart', :after? => @headline)
    * Removed NAVIGATION_CHECKER from Watir.rb, added to contrib. This fixes rdoc generation and stops the frame access exception being thrown in the default installation.
    * Open-code calls to def_creator, for easier debugging and rdoc generation of factory methods.
    * Winclicker fix for too many callbacks defined error.
    * Patch for rspec API changes
    * You can now reference an iframe using IE#frame(:id, 'whatever'). Jira 109
    * Added 'map' and 'area' element support.
    * Moved Watir::Assertions into new file watir/assertions.rb so they can be used outside test cases.
    * Fix and unit test for Jira 114, related to tag in HTML source.
    * Added SelectList#include? and SelectList#selected?
    * Added Element#visible?
    * Fixes all reported bugs with contains_text.
    * New Watir::TestCase#verify method (and verify_equal and verify_match).
    * The click_no_wait method now works in frames.
    * Released new IE.new_process method to 'watir/contrib/ie-new-process'. This starts up a new IE process for each IE window, which is really how it should be done. To close these use IE#kill. Any one getting intermittent RPC errors when opening windows may want to use this instead.
    * Several examples have been updated.
    * Moved enabled_popup to a new contrib directory.
    * Added several tests.
