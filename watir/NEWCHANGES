== Version 1.7.0

This is a release candidate.

* Browser.attach is now available.
* Browser.options and Browser.set_options are now available.
* Add support for definition lists, this adds these methods:
  dd, dt, dl, dds, dts, dls. (Jarib)
* Hidden#visible? should always return false. (Jarib)
* New method execute_script.
* Add ElementCollections#size as alias of length. (Jarib)
* Some camelCase => snake_case renames (with aliasing). (Jarib)
    Image#fileCreatedDate       => file_created_date
    Image#fileSize              => file_size
    Image#hasLoaded?            => loaded?

=== Firefox Improvements

* SelectList#set is now defined for Firefox. Like with IE, it is an alias for
  SelectList#select. [271]
* Element collections are now enumerable. This allows methods such as @select@
  and @map@ to be used with methods such as @divs@ and @links@.
* FireWatir.attach is now available, analogous to IE.attach.
* Some Javascript errors that were being ignored, now raise Ruby exceptions.
* Added event handler which resets the context of document 
when page gets loaded automatically (Angrez)

=== IE Improvements

* Allow attach timeout to be accessed as an option. Thus:
    IE.set_options :attach_timeout => 5.0
  This was previously available as class method.
*   

=== Structure Improvements

* Lots of rework of the FireWatir code, including removing duplication and 
  dead code, renaming variables, and simplifying code. Also a few performance
  improvements.
* Rename source file names for consistency.
  
=== Unit Tests

* Add tests demonstrating known bugs.
* Make the "window" tests run more reliably.
* Relocate unreliable tests.
* Tag tests that are known to fail on IE or Firefox.
* Fixed one test that was failing on non-English platforms. (Jarib)
* New Rake task (:test) runs all tests.
* Use ci_reporter to provide more detailed test results for watirbuild.com.
