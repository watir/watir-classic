  when page gets loaded automatically (Angrez)

  "document", "body", "window", "browser" variables. (Angrez)

  doesn't give error while executing the xpath query (Angrez)

 browserless windows and others (Rob Aldred)
* Add test and implementation for Firefox#status http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-250 (Jarib)

=== Unit Tests

* Add tests demonstrating known bugs.
* Make the "window" tests run more reliably.
