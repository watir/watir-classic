<h1>Scripting for Testers</h1>

	<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

	<p>These instructions describe how to install the software we&#8217;ll use in our Scripting for Testers class.</p>

	<p>We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and <span class="caps">WTR</span> (a library) on your machine to test server software. You can run the server software on your computer. In some cases, we use a classroom network so that you can access the same server software running on your instructor&#8217;s machine.</p>

	<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

	<p><B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000 or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B></p>

	<p>We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we don&#8217;t support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that machines that are still running these operating systems often are too slow or have other problems that we don&#8217;t have time for in a class environment. Sorry.)</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">WTR</span> software requires Internet Explorer and therefore only runs on Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux, Windows). The Timeclock &#8220;product tests&#8221; will not run on Windows using the mswin build (the one you use for the class). They will run on Windows using the cygwin build.</p>

	<h3>Installing the Software</h3>

	<h4>Ruby</h4>

	<p>We are currently using this Ruby installer:  <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&#38;release_id=414">ruby181-12.exe.</a>  (There are known problems with ruby 1.8.1-13; don&#8217;t use it.)</p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Double-click this exe file to install.</li>
		<li>     Select the default installation options (choose all options;
       install in c:/ruby).  </li>
		<li>     If you are installing as Administrator you don&#8217;t need to
       restart windows. Otherwise, you should.  </li>
	</ol>

	<h4><span class="caps">IE </span>Controller</h4>

	<p>You will need to install this Ruby library: <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&#38;release_id=305">iec.2004.054.0.zip</a>    </p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Unzip this file onto your hard drive (c:). An &#8220;iec&#8221; directory</li>
		<li>     will be created automatically.</li>
		<li>     Start up a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter &#8220;cmd&#8221;.)</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;cd iec&#8221;.</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;ruby install.rb&#8221;.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>(You can also install this by just double-clicking the install.rb icon in windows explorer. The problem with this method is that you won&#8217;t see any error messages.) </p>

	<h4>Scripting Class Materials.</h4>

	<p>You will also need the materials hosted on rubyforge.org: <a href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/wtr/scripting101/scripting101.tar.gz?tarball=1&#38;cvsroot=wtr">wtr/scripting101.tar.gz</a></p>

	<ol>
	<li>Extract the contents of this archive into your hard drive (c:). A
  &#8220;scripting101&#8221; directory will be created automatically.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Running the Timeclock Server.</h3>

	<p>You probably won&#8217;t need to do this for class, since you can use your instructor&#8217;s server. Otherwise, here is how to start up a timeclock server on your machine. </p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Start a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter &#8220;cmd&#8221;.)</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;cd c:\scripting101\timeclock\bin&#8221;.</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;ruby http-server.rb&#8221;. The server is now running.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note: If you close this command window, the server will stop.</p>

	<p>You can verify that the server is running correctly by running some sample tests.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Start a new command shell.</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;ruby c:\scripting101\solutions\suite.rb -b&#8221;.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note: These tests will run unbearably slowly if Internet Explorer is  configured to use a proxy server that is unavailable.</p>
