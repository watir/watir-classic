<h1>Scripting Web Tests</h1>

	<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

	<p>These instructions describe how to install the software we use in our <em>Scripting Web Tests</em> class (also called <em>Scripting for Testers</em>).</p>

	<p>We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and Watir (a library) on your machine to test server software. You will also run the server software on your computer. </p>

	<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

	<p><B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000 or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B></p>

	<p>We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we don&#8217;t support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that machines that are still running these operating systems often are too slow or have other problems that we don&#8217;t have time to support in a class environment. Sorry.)</p>

	<p>The Watir library requires Internet Explorer and therefore only runs on  Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux, Mac, Windows). (The Timeclock &#8220;product tests&#8221; will not run on Windows using the mswin build&#8212;the one you use for the class. They will run on Windows using the cygwin build.)</p>

	<h3>Installing the Software</h3>

	<p>Students are provided with a CD that includes all of the software  referenced here. For your convenience we also provide links to where  these materials can be found online.</p>

	<h4>Ruby</h4>

	<p>We are currently using  <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&#38;release_id=1346">Ruby for Windows 1.8.2-14</a>  (There are known problems with Ruby 1.8.1-13; don&#8217;t use it.)</p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Double-click this exe file to install.</li>
		<li>     Select the default installation options (choose all options;
       install in c:/ruby).  </li>
		<li>     If you are installing as Administrator you don&#8217;t need to
       restart windows. Otherwise, you should.  </li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Watir</h4>

	<p>We are using <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&#38;release_id=2164">Watir 1.3.1</a></p>

	<ol>
	<li>Unzip this into c:\watir</li>
		<li>Execute install.rb</li>
		<li>Use all the default installation options</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Scripting Class Materials</h4>

	<p>We are using <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&#38;release_id=2181">Scripting101 1.5.2</a></p>

	<ol>
	<li>Extract the contents of this archive into your hard drive (c:). A
  &#8220;scripting101&#8221; directory will be created automatically.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>SpySmith</h4>

	<p>We are using <a href="http://www.qualityforge.com/download/spysmith.zip">SpySmith v 1.0</a> from QualityForge.  This is a commercial tool available for free as a 90-day evaluation.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Open the zip file using WinZip.</li>
		<li>Extract all files in this zip archive to top-level drive, e.g. C:\ or D:\ etc. (or create a directory to use as your top-level).</li>
	<ul>
	<li>The extraction will create the following directories, assuming you extracted to C:\
	<ul>
	<li><code>C:\QualityForge\SpySmith</code>
     contains spysmith.exe, qfss01.dll</li>
		<li><code>C:\QualityForge\SpySmith\Docs</code>
     contains local html help docs</li>
		<li><code>C:\QualityForge\SpySmith\Docs\gifs</code>
     contains local image files</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Open the containing folder and double-click the SpySmith icon to run the program.</li>
	</ol></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Running the Timeclock Server.</h3>

	<p>You will need to start up a timeclock server on your machine. </p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Start a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter &#8220;cmd&#8221;.)</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;cd c:\scripting101\timeclock\bin&#8221;.</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;ruby http-server.rb&#8221;. The server is now running.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note: If you close this command window, the server will stop.</p>

	<p>You can verify that the server is running correctly by running some sample tests.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Start a new command shell.</li>
		<li>     Enter &#8220;ruby c:\scripting101\solutions\suite.rb -b&#8221;.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note: These tests will run unbearably slowly if Internet Explorer is  configured to use a proxy server that happens to be unavailable.</p>
