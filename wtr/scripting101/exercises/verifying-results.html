	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 4: Verifying Results</h2>

	<p>You&#8217;ve written some scripts that demonstrate your ability to automate an internet browser. But they aren&#8217;t really tests. Because they don&#8217;t really check the results. Now it is time to take care of that.</p>

	<p>Refer to the <a href="../../doc/Internet%20Explorer%20Cheat%20Sheet.doc">Scripting Web Tests Cheat Sheet</a> for several testing methods. The Ruby Cheat Sheet describes the syntax of an if-then statement in Ruby.</p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Experimenting with Test Methods.</strong> In <span class="caps">IRB</span>, load your &#8220;start the day&#8221; 
     test script and then experiment with different test methods to
     verify whether the test ran correctly. Update the script so that
     it prints a message indicating whether these tests pass or fail. </li>
		<li>  <strong>Start, Stop, and Verify.</strong> Revise the start, stop and pause test
     script so that it checks the results.</li>
	</ol>
