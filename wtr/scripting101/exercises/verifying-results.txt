h2=. Scripting for Testers

h2=. Lab 4: Verifying Results

You've written some scripts that demonstrate your ability to automate
an internet browser. But they aren't really tests. Because they don't
really check the results. Now it is time to take care of that.

Refer to the "Scripting Web Tests Cheat Sheet":../../doc/Internet%20Explorer%20Cheat%20Sheet.doc for several
testing methods. The Ruby Cheat Sheet describes the syntax of an if-then
statement in Ruby.

# *Experimenting with Test Methods.* In IRB, load your "start the day"
     test script and then experiment with different test methods to
     verify whether the test ran correctly. Update the script so that
     it prints a message indicating whether these tests pass or fail.

#   *Start, Stop, and Verify.* Revise the start, stop and pause test
     script so that it checks the results.
