h2=. Lab 5: Harnessing Tests

You've written a number of tests. Now it's time to put them all
together with a test harness. This will allow them to run in sequence
and automatically report whether any of the tests fail.

The following code demonstrates how to create a simple test harness
that loads one test script.

<pre>
require 'test/unit'
class LoadTestScript < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_login_start
    load 'login-start.rb'
  end
  def teardown
    $ie.close if $ie
  end
end
</pre>

You can add additional tests, by defining additional methods to the
class whose names begin with 'test_' that load the desired
scripts. 

# *Test Harness.* Create a test harness that executes all of your test
scripts.

# *Assertions.* Printing out PASS or FAIL is no longer an effective
testing strategy when running multiple tests in a harness. You need
your tests to know for themselves whether they pass or fail. The way
to do this is with assertions. Assertions directly check a value. If
it's as expected, nothing happens. When it isn't, an exception is
raised, which will be caught and reported by the test harness. Several
generic assertion methods are listed in the cheat sheet, along with
some that are specific to the Timeclock application. Convert your
tests to using assertions. These are detailed on page 2 of the Scripting Web
Tests cheat sheet.

h3=. Bonus Exercises

If you have time, you may want to try the following:

# *Record Check.* Write another test script. Start with a user that
    has no time records. Record time sessions for two separate jobs,
    one session for each. Verify that two time records appear.

# *Test Strategy.* Look over the test ideas you developed in Lab 1.
   Write a test script for one or more of your ideas.
