	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 3: Writing Scripts</h2>

	<p>Now that you&#8217;ve used <span class="caps">IRB</span> to drive Internet Explorer, it is time to create a script. Actually, you&#8217;ll create several. Create each script using Scite, the ruby editor. You may wish to try the commands in <span class="caps">IRB</span> first, to make sure they are right.</p>

	<p>There are three ways to run scripts: </p>

	<ol>
	<li>The simplest method is to type F5 while editing the scripting in
  Scite. This will save the file and then execute it. The output will
  be displayed in a separate window. </li>
		<li>A second method is to run a script from the system command
  line. Type &#8220;ruby script-name.rb&#8221; at the <span class="caps">DOS</span> prompt. This is the most
  reliable method. Use it you are having trouble using F5 in Scite. </li>
		<li>A third method is to load the script into <span class="caps">IRB</span>. Type &#8220;load
  &#8216;script-name.rb&#8217;&#8221; at the <span class="caps">IRB</span> prompt. The advantage of this method is
  that you can check variables and interact with the <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller
  after the script has run. This gives you a method for debugging your
  scripts.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When you automate tests, you need to be able to repeat tests much more precisely than when you are testing manually. The &#8216;ensure_no_user_data&#8217; method has been specifically provided as a testability feature for timeclock. You may find it useful.</p>

	<p>You will also have to make sure you call &#8220;wait&#8221; after each click or submit command. These interact with the server, and you will get hard-to-debug synchronization bugs if you don&#8217;t do this. &#8220;wait&#8221; is a command that waits for the browser to stop downloading. It waits a variable amount of time.</p>

	<p>Create and execute each of these scripts. As you complete each script, demonstrate it to your instructors.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>   <strong>Start The Day.</strong> This script logs in and navigates to the main time
     clock page, and then starts the day. </li>
		<li>   <strong>Start, Stop and Pause.</strong> This script starts, stops, pauses, and
      restarts a job. You decide the order for these actions. </li>
		<li>   <strong>Job Switching.</strong> This script creates two jobs and then switches
      back and forth between them every few seconds. The command to
      sleep for 5 seconds in ruby is &#8220;sleep 5&#8221;.</li>
	</ol>
