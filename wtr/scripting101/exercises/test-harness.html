<h2 style="text-align:center;">Scripting for Testers</h2>

	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 5: Harnessing Tests</h2>

	<p>You&#8217;ve written a number of tests. Now it&#8217;s time to put them all together with a test harness. This will allow them to run in sequence and automatically report whether any of the tests fail.</p>

	<p>The following code demonstrates how to create a simple test harness that loads one test script.</p>

<pre> require 'test/unit' class LoadTestScript &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_login_start
    load 'login-start.rb'
  end
  def teardown
    $ie.close if $ie
  end end </pre>

	<p>You can add additional tests, by defining additional methods to the class whose names begin with &#8216;test_&#8217; that load the desired scripts. </p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Test Harness.</strong> Create a test harness that executes all of your test scripts. </li>
		<li><strong>Assertions.</strong> Printing out <span class="caps">PASS</span> or <span class="caps">FAIL</span> is no longer an effective testing strategy when running multiple tests in a harness. You need your tests to know for themselves whether they pass or fail. The way to do this is with assertions. Assertions directly check a value. If it&#8217;s as expected, nothing happens. When it isn&#8217;t, an exception is raised, which will be caught and reported by the test harness. Several generic assertion methods are listed in the cheat sheet, along with some that are specific to the Timeclock application. Convert your tests to using assertions. These are detailed on page 2 of the Scripting Web Tests cheat sheet.</li>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Bonus Exercises</h3>

	<p>If you have time, you may want to try the following:</p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Record Check.</strong> Write another test script. Start with a user that
    has no time records. Record time sessions for two separate jobs,
    one session for each. Verify that two time records appear. </li>
		<li><strong>Test Strategy.</strong> Look over the test ideas you developed in Lab 1.
   Write a test script for one or more of your ideas.</li>
