Class <code>Fluid</code> provides dynamically scoped ("fluid") variables modeled
after those of Common Lisp. It also gives you a convenient way to
reversibly change the values of globals.
</p>
<h2><a name="label:0" id="label:0">Globals
</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "Globals" -->
<p>
Suppose that you want to change the value of <code>$defout</code>
temporarily. Here's how:
</p>
<pre>
require 'fluid'

Fluid.let(["$defout", File.open("logfile", "w"), :close]) {
  puts "This will go to 'logfile'."
}
puts "This will not."
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the IO stream is closed after the original value is
restored.
</p>
<p>
You could do this yourself with <code>begin...ensure...end</code>, but <code>Fluid.let</code>
is a bit more concise. Moreover, certain global variables (like
<code>$stderr</code>) have to be set and restored specially, in a way that's
historically confused people. Finally, some variables (like
<code>$stdin</code> and <code>$stdout</code>) can't be successfully restored.
<code>Fluid.let</code> refuses to try, which makes problems that would otherwise be
obscure more clear.
</p>
<h2><a name="label:1" id="label:1">An Alternative to Globals
</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "An Alternative to Globals" -->
<p>
When you use <code>Fluid.let</code>, you're distinguishing two parts of your
program: a part that uses the variable's value, and another part that
wraps the first part. In the above example, code that logs to
<code>$defout</code> is wrapped by code that decides where logging should go.
</p>
<p>
Quite often, this wrapping is nested. For
example, you might use <code>Fluid.let</code> to produce a nicely nested
trace like this:
</p>
<pre>
fact(5)
  fact(4)
    fact(3)
      fact(2)
        fact(1)
        fact(1) =&gt; 1
      fact(2) =&gt; 2
    fact(3) =&gt; 6
  fact(4) =&gt; 24
fact(5) =&gt; 120
</pre>
<p>
The code is shown below. In effect, it wraps each call to <code>fact</code>
in a <code>Fluid.let</code> that increases the indentation level. Each return
from <code>fact</code> decreases the level. So when you are executing
<code>fact(1)</code>, you're inside five nested <code>Fluid.let</code> blocks. 
</p>
<p>
A problem with globals is that they can be used in lots of different
ways. If you see a global in some code, you don't necessarily know
whether it's being used in this wrapping style or in some other
way. Globals are not "intention revealing". 
</p>
<p>
Enter fluid variables. 
</p>
<pre>
require 'fluid'

Fluid.let([:var1, 1]) {
  puts(Fluid.var1)  # prints 1
}
puts(Fluid.var1)    # error - Fluid.var1 does not exist
</pre>
<p>
<code>Fluid.var1</code> is much like a global, but whenever you see it in
code, you know that code is intended to be wrapped inside a <code>Fluid.let</code>.
</p>
<p>
Like globals, fluid variables can be referenced outside of the method
that creates them. Suppose you have this method:
</p>
<pre>
def incrementing_printer
  Fluid.var1 += 1
  puts(Fluid.var1)
end
</pre>
<p>
That method could be called from anywhere without error, so long as a
<code>Fluid.let</code> for <code>var1</code> were executing:
</p>
<pre>
Fluid.let([:var1, 0]) {
  3.times do 
    incrementing_printer  # prints 1, 2, 3
  end
}
</pre>
<p>
Here's how the indented tracing shown above could be
implemented. Rather than use <code>Fluid.let</code> directly, I'll use it in
a special-purpose <code>indenting-trace</code> method. Here's <code>fact</code>:
</p>
<pre>
def fact(n)
  indenting_trace('fact', n) {   # wrapping method
    if (n &lt;= 1)
      n
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end
  }
end
</pre>
<p>
Here's the definition of <code>indenting_trace</code>: 
</p>
<pre>
Fluid.defvar(:indent, "")  # initial value.

def indenting_trace(name, *args)
  call_string = "#{Fluid.indent}#{name}(#{args.join(', ')})"
  puts call_string
  retval = Fluid.let([:indent, Fluid.indent + "  "]) {
    yield
  }
  puts "#{call_string} =&gt; #{retval.inspect}"
  retval
end
</pre>
<p>
Here's a final example that shows the syntax and behavior of
<code>Fluid.let</code>. See also the more formal description below.
</p>
<pre>
Fluid.let([:var1, 1],
          [:var2, 2]) {
  puts(Fluid.var1)              # prints 1
  puts(Fluid.var2)              # prints 2
  Fluid.let([:var2, "new 2"],
            [:var3, "new 3"]) {
    puts(Fluid.var1)               # prints 1, as above.
    puts(Fluid.var2)               # prints "new 2"
    puts(Fluid.var3)               # prints "new 3"
  }
  puts(Fluid.var1)              # prints 1
  puts(Fluid.var2)              # Back to printing 2
  puts(Fluid.var3)              # error - that variable no longer exists.
}
</pre>
<h2><a name="label:2" id="label:2">Class Methods 
</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "Class Methods" -->
<dl>
<dt><a name="Fluid_S_let" id="Fluid_S_let"><code>Fluid.let(<var>variable</var>-<var>specifications</var>) { <var>block</var> }</code></a></dt><!-- RDLabel: "Fluid.let" -->
<dd>
<p>
Puts the variable specifications in effect, then executes the block,
undoes the variable specifications, and returns the block's value.
</p>

<p>
A single variable specification has one of three forms. A variable name by
itself is given the value nil:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let(:will_have_value_nil) {...}
</pre>

<p>
A variable specification may also be a two-element array, where the
first element is the variable name and the second is its value:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let([:will_have_value_1, 1]) {...}
</pre>

<p>
Finally, there may be a third element in the array, the <em>value destructor</em>. It is most often
used to close an open file:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let([:out, File.open("logfile", 'w'), :close]) {...}
</pre>

<p>
Specifically, the value destructor may be either a <code>Proc</code> or the
name of a method. If it's the name of a method, 
it is sent as a message to the value of the
second argument.
Otherwise, it's a <code>Proc</code> that's called with the value of the second
argument as 
its single parameter: 
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let([:out, File.open("logfile", 'w'),
                 proc {|io| io.close}]) {...}
</pre>

<p>
The three forms can be mixed.
</p>

<p>
From the moment the block begins to execute until the moment it returns,
getters and setters for the variables are made class methods of Fluid:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let([:var, 1]) {
  Fluid.var       # has value 1
  Fluid.var = 2   # change value to 2
}
</pre>

<p>
If, however, the variable name begins with '$', <code>Fluid.let</code> realizes
it's a global variable and gives that variable a new value. 
No getters or setters are created.
The old
value is still restored when the block exits.
</p>

<p>
References to the variable needn't be in the lexical scope of the
<code>Fluid.let</code>. They can be anywhere in the program.
</p>

<p>
Variable names can be strings or symbols.
</p>

<p>
Variable specifications are undone even if the block exits with a
throw or an exception.
</p>

<p>
If a fluid variable (like <code>Fluid.myvar</code>) is used when no block of 
a <code>Fluid.let</code> that names it
is executing,
a <code>NameError</code> results. (But see also <a href="#Fluid_S_defvar">Fluid.defvar</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="Fluid_S_defvar" id="Fluid_S_defvar"><code>Fluid.defvar(<var>name</var>, <var>optional</var>-<var>value</var>) { <var>optional</var>-<var>block</var> }</code></a></dt><!-- RDLabel: "Fluid.defvar" -->
<dd>
<p>
A global declaration of a fluid variable. After executing this code:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.defvar(:global, 5) 
</pre>

<p>
<code>Fluid.global</code> will normally everywhere have the value 5, unless it's
changed by assignment or <code>Fluid.let</code>.
</p>

<p>
However, <code>Fluid.defvar</code> has effect only the first time it's executed.
That is, given this sequence:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.defvar(:global, 5)
Fluid.defvar(:global, 6666666)
</pre>

<p>
<code>Fluid.global</code> has value 5. The second <code>Fluid.defvar</code> is ignored. [Note:
I'm not at all sure this behavior is useful, but it's the way 
Common Lisp does it. ]
</p>

<p>
A <code>Fluid.defvar</code> executed while a <code>Fluid.let</code> block is in effect will
have no effect:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.let([:not_global, 1]) {
  Fluid.defvar(:not_global, 5555)   # Fluid.not_global == 1
}
# The defvar has had no effect, so Fluid.not_global
# has no value after the block.
</pre>

<p>
<code>Fluid.defvar</code> can take a block as an argument:
</p>

<pre>
Fluid.defvar(:var) { long_and_expensive_computation }
</pre>

<p>
The block is only executed if its value would be assigned to the
variable.
</p>

<p>
The first argument to <code>Fluid.defvar</code> may not be the name of 
a global variable.
