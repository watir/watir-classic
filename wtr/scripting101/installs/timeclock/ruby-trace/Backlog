Tell people what to do next in the installation guide.

Make the examples that are hyperlinked to in the documentation .txt

Tell people how to use ruby-trace in IRB. 

Maybe $trace.foo_value should take multiple variable names, split them
apart, and use them as args. Avoids this:
      $trace.announce_value { 'helodom' } 
      $trace.announce_value { 'user' } 
      $trace.announce_value { 'secret' } 
      $trace.announce_value { 'authtype' } 

Link ruby-trace into the Ruby Packages structure on the web site. Will
require updating the HTML installation scripts. 


Can use Module:module_function to make assertion methods available as
