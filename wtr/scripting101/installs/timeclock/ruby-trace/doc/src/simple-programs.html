<h2 align="left">Tracing simple programs</h2>

<p align="left">This section introduces some of the key ideas of
Ruby-trace by talking about tracing simple programs. Even if
you're working on a big server program, you should read this
section.</p>

<p align="left">What's a simple program? </p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">It's one that you can run from the
        command line. It's a script or a utility rather than a
        server that runs continuously.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">It's one single blob of code, rather than
        being partitioned into distinct and relatively
        independent subsystems.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Unlike the tracing that's built into Ruby, you
have to add tracing statements to your code. In exchange for that
trouble, you get more control over what you see. In particular,
you can arrange it so that you're not overwhelmed with detail. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="a_first_example">A first example</a></h3>

<p align="left">Let's begin with a simple example, which you can
find in <a href="examples/print-example.rb">print-example.rb</a>
in the doc/examples subdirectory of the Ruby-trace root directory.
When you run that program in the normal way, it looks like any
other Ruby program. You see no special output:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">% ruby print-example.rb
    arg<br>
    called with 'arg'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">However, if the program is behaving incorrectly,
you can ask for trace output by invoking the program with <font
face="Courier New">ruby-trace</font>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">% <strong>ruby-trace</strong>
    print-example.rb arg<br>
    <strong>print-example.rb:21:in `initialize'<br>
    = announce: New instance of Example: 'Example one'<br>
    print-example.rb:21:in `initialize'<br>
    = announce: New instance of Example: 'Example two'<br>
    </strong>called with 'arg'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Here, Ruby-trace is displaying <strong>announce</strong>
messages, which mark significant occurrences in the life of the
program. The programmer also added trace messages that provide
more detail. By default, they're not displayed. To see that
detail, you tell Ruby-trace to change the <strong>threshold</strong>
that controls how much detail is printed:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">% <strong>ruby-trace
    --threshold verbose</strong> print-example.rb arg<br>
    print-example.rb:21:in `initialize'<br>
    = announce: New instance of Example: 'Example one'<br>
    print-example.rb:21:in `initialize'<br>
    = announce: New instance of Example: 'Example two'<br>
    <strong>print-example.rb:25:in `do_something_detailed'<br>
    = verbose: something detailed has happened<br>
    </strong>called with 'arg'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">(Note: if you are an Emacs user, you may find
&quot;visit-ruby-source.el&quot; convenient. It lets you put the
cursor on a line containing trace output, compiler error
messages, or a location from a stack dump, hit a magic key, and
be taken to the source. It's in the directory &quot;elisp&quot;
under the Ruby-trace root directory.)</p>

<p align="left">How does this all work? Here are the important
parts of the example:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
require 'ruby-trace/start/global'

class Example

  def initialize (tag)
    @tag = tag
    $trace.announce "New instance of #{self.class}: '#{self.inspect}'"
  end

  def do_something_detailed
    $trace.verbose 'something detailed has happened'
  end
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The first line</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">require 'ruby-trace/start/global'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">defines the global <font face="Courier New">$trace</font>,
which we will call here a <strong>trace object</strong>. (In <a
href="server-programs.html#connectors_as_topics">a later section</a>,
we'll see that it's actually two kinds of object.) You can send a
<strong>trace message</strong> to the trace object. The following
is an <strong>announce</strong> message.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.announce
    &quot;New instance of #{self.class}: #{self}&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">This line sends a <strong>verbose</strong>
message</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.verbose
    'something detailed has happened'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">There are several other levels - see below.</p>

<p align="left">Now let's look at this new terminology in more
detail. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="the_default_trace_object">The default
trace object</a></h3>

<p align="left">The include file <font face="Courier New">ruby-trace/start/global</font>
defines the global <font face="Courier New">$trace</font>. If
you're allergic to global variables, you can instead add a method
named <font face="Courier New">trace</font> to Object:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">require 'ruby-trace/start/<strong>method</strong>'<br>
    ...<br>
    <strong>trace</strong>.announce &quot;New instance of #{self.class}:
    #{self}&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">If you're allergic to all pollution of the global
namespace, you can require <font face="Courier New">ruby-trace/all</font>.
You'll then have to create trace objects yourself. That's not
described in this section.</p>

<p align="left">In the remainder of this documentation, I'll use
the global <font face="Courier New">$trace</font>. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="trace_levels">Trace levels</a></h3>

<p align="left">Trace messages have several <strong>levels</strong>.
Programmers use lower level messages to provide more detail. You
can control at runtime or launch time which level of messages you
want to see. You may also define your own levels (described in
later sections of this guide).</p>

<p align="left">Here are the default levels, together with their
usual meaning:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>error</strong></dt>
    <dd>Use <strong>error </strong>messages when your program has
        detected an internal error. </dd>
    <dt><strong>warning</strong></dt>
    <dd><strong>Warning</strong> messages are not as serious as
        errors, but they're signs of something odd. If the
        program blows up later, a warning message might mark the
        point where things started to go wrong.</dd>
    <dt><strong>announce</strong></dt>
    <dd><strong>Announce</strong> messages record major
        milestones in the life of the program. For example, if
        the program connects to one of several FTP servers, does
        its work, and shuts down, an <strong>announce</strong>
        message might record which server it used.</dd>
    <dt><strong>event</strong></dt>
    <dd><strong>Event</strong> messages will be sent more often
        than <strong>announce</strong> messages. They are
        typically used to record significant interactions with
        the outside world. For example, each command a user types
        might cause an event message to be logged. (In larger
        programs that are composed of multiple subsystems, <strong>event</strong>
        messages are typically used to record calls into
        subsystem interface methods.)</dd>
    <dt><strong>debug </strong></dt>
    <dd><strong>Debug </strong>messages are normally not printed.
        Typically, they're added to help track down a bug. They
        might record that the program reached a certain point
        with certain significant values. If <strong>debug</strong>
        messages seem likely to be useful with similar bugs in
        the future, leave them in. Over time, you'll accumulate
        enough debugging that most bugs become easy to isolate. </dd>
    <dt><strong>verbose </strong></dt>
    <dd><b>Verbose </b>messages provide even more detail than <b>debug</b>.
        They're probably mainly used when first getting the code
        to work. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 align="left"><a name="the_trace_threshold">The trace
threshold</a></h3>

<p align="left">At any given moment, the <strong>threshold</strong>
is set to one of the levels or to <strong>none</strong>. If it's
set to a level, messages of that level and above will be logged.
If the threshold is set to <strong>none</strong>, nothing will be
logged. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="invoking_trace_methods">Invoking trace
methods</a></h3>

<p align="left">Trace methods may be invoked in three ways:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>$trace.<em>level</em> <em>aString</em></dt>
    <dd>If the threshold allows, the given string is logged.</dd>
    <dt>$trace.<em>level</em></dt>
    <dd>This has the same effect as if <em>aString</em> were
        &quot;Reached here&quot;. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
    <dt>$trace.<em>level</em> { <em>block </em>}</dt>
    <dd>The block should produce a string, which is logged as if
        it were given to the first form of the method. The block
        is only evaluated if the threshold is higher than or
        equal to the <em>level</em>. This is a useful alternative
        to the first form when construction of the string is
        expensive. For example, if the string is <font
        face="Courier New">&quot;val=#{ackerman(4,4)}&quot;</font>,
        you'd hate to pay the expense of building the string
        unless <em>level</em> were actually above the threshold.
        Since, in Ruby, creating blocks seems to be cheaper than
        even the simplest strings, this is the form to use if you
        are worried about efficiency.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you <em>are</em> worried about efficiency, you might like
to know that the level methods are so constructed that they are
empty if the <em>level</em> is below the threshold. That is, the
default definition of <font face="Courier New">$trace.verbose</font>
is this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Courier New">def $trace.verbose (aString)<br>
    end</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">It gets redefined if the threshold changes. </p>

<p align="left">Thanks to a suggestion of Dave Thomas, there is a
variant set of methods. It can be tiresome to write trace
statements like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.verbose {
    &quot;name -&gt; #{name}&quot; }</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">So you can instead write this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.verbose_value
    {&quot;name&quot;}</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Each of the level methods (<font
face="Courier New">error</font>, <font face="Courier New">warning</font>,
etc.) has a <font face="Courier New">_value</font> variant.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="turning_tracing_on_at_launch_time">Turning
tracing on at launch time</a></h3>

<p align="left">Normally, no tracing output appears because the
threshold is set to <strong>none</strong>. </p>

<p align="left">At startup, the trace object obeys an environment
variable called TRACEENV. If that variable's value is </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">--threshold=<em>level</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">then the threshold will be set to the given level.
(The odd notation is because there are other things you can do
with the environment.)</p>

<p align="left">Here's an example, using the Bash shell:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">export TRACEENV=&quot;--threshold=event&quot;<br>
    ruby myprog.rb</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Because messing with the environment is awkward,
the <font face="Courier New">ruby-trace</font> program does it
for you. The above is equivalent to this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">ruby-trace myprog.rb</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Ruby-trace</font>'s
options (<font face="Courier New">--threshold</font> and its
equivalent, <font face="Courier New">-t</font>) just set the
TRACEENV to different values. </p>
