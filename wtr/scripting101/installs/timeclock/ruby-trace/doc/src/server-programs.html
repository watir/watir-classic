<h2 align="left">Tracing server programs</h2>

<p align="left">This section describes using Ruby-trace with
larger programs. Larger programs probably are not started from
the command line, so they probably need to log to disk. They are
probably composed of semi-independent subsystems, each of which
may need to be traced differently.</p>

<p align="left">At this point, we need to talk a bit more about
what kind of thing <font face="Courier New">$trace</font> is. It
is a <font face="Courier New">Connector</font> object, so called
because it connects <em>topics</em> with particular <em>themes</em>
to certain <em>destinations</em>. (The definitions of these terms
will be introduced in due course.) Simple programs could avoid
knowing about Connectors by requiring the appropriate file.
Server programs need to do a bit of specific initialization. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="logging_to_disk">Logging to disk</a></h3>

<p align="left">The simplest way to log to disk is to execute a
statement like this early in your program:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">This class method causes trace messages to flow
to two destinations. A destination is an object that accepts
trace messages and does something useful with them. The first
destination is the buffer already described in Tracing simple
programs. It records trace messages at or above the <strong>event
</strong>threshold. The second is a logfile whose default name is
&quot;Tracelog.txt&quot;. (To change the default name, give your
preferred name as an argument to the call.) The logfile records
trace messages at or above the <strong>announce</strong>
threshold. </p>

<p align="left">The effect is that the logfile holds low-frequency,
high-importance messages, while the buffer holds more frequent
messages that are probably only important if a problem happens.
In that case, you can &quot;drain&quot; the buffer into the
logfile with this command:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.drain('buffer',
    'file')</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">See &quot;<a href="examples/drain-example.rb">drain-example.rb</a>&quot;
in the doc/examples subdirectory. </p>

<p align="left">Messages in logfiles look a bit different than
messages printed to standard output. They have timestamps:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">usage-example-2.rb:11:in
    `initialize' <strong>at 2001/07/20 00:05:31</strong><br>
    = announce: User interface starts.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The timestamps appear both on messages printed
directly to the logfile and also on those drained from the buffer.
The format can be changed. See <a
href="API.html#LogfileDestination_formatter_eq">LogfileDestination#format=</a>
in the <a href="API.html">API</a>.</p>

<h4 align="left"><a name="controlling_two_destinations">Controlling
two destinations</a></h4>

<p align="left">The thresholds of the two destinations can be
controlled independently. At runtime, a destination is controlled
using this method:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">set_threshold(<em>aDestinationName,
    aLevelName</em>)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The following calls set the logfile threshold to <strong>warning</strong>
and the buffer threshold to <strong>debug</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.set_threshold('file',
    'warning')<br>
    $trace.set_threshold('buffer', 'debug')</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">At launch time, the two destinations obey the
environment variable TRACEENV. It consists of a series of <em>trace
environment commands</em> separated by spaces, semicolons, or
colons. Each trace environment command has this format:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">-<em>aDestinationName</em>-threshold=<em>aLevelName</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">(There's more to the format than this, but this
is enough for now.)</p>

<p align="left">So the same effect as the above two calls can be
had with this environment:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">TRACEENV=&quot;-file-threshold=warning
    -buffer-threshold=debug&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="left"><a name="timestamped_files">Timestamped files</a></h4>

<p align="left">You may want each new invocation of the server to
use a new log file. It's convenient to identify each with a
timestamp. This can be done by putting the tag %t in the
logfile's name.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file
    'Tracelog.%t.txt'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">results in a logfile like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Tracelog.20010719125656.txt</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">That logfile was created at 12:56:56 on July 19,
2001. Each time the server starts, it will create a new logfile.
The timestamp format is such that an alphabetical file listing of
the logfiles is in the order in which they were created. </p>

<h4 align="left"><a name="backup_files">Backup files</a></h4>

<p align="left"><em>Note: this is a way of handling backup files
that I've used in the past. It works OK, but I'm considering
replacing it (or adding to it) with one or two other alternatives.
The first alternative would always retain the first backup file (since
it contains startup logging likely to be useful in the future).
It would also always cycle through backup files starting with '000',
instead of adding to the most recent backup file. (This makes
more sense if we don't care about preserving the logs from
previous runs.) The second alternative would reopen the backup
file at periodic intervals (like once a day) instead of based on
file size. There'll be discussion on the mailing list.</em></p>

<p align="left">If the logfile name contains the tag %b, an
existing file will be renamed instead of overwritten. As an
example, suppose no logfile exists and your program initializes
tracing this way:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file
    'Tracelog%b.txt'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The first time you run the server, there will be
a single logfile:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Tracelog.txt</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">If you shutdown and restart, you'll then have two
files:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
Tracelog.000.txt   # contains the log for run 1
Tracelog.txt       # contains the log for run 2
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">If you shutdown and restart again, you'll still
have two files:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
Tracelog.000.txt   # contains the log for run 2 (the log for run 1 is gone)
Tracelog.txt       # contains the log for run 3
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">(Notice that the backup file has had &quot;%b&quot;
replaced by &quot;.000&quot; - you needn't add a period.)</p>

<p align="left">A more typical use of backup files would be this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file('Tracelog%b.txt',
                                                    "a", 
                                                    10000000,
                                                    "010")
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">When tracing is initialized, the logfile is
appended to. (The default choice is &quot;w&quot;, which means to
create a new logfile after renaming the old to a backup file.)
The logfile will be closed, renamed, and reopened when it exceeds
10 megabytes in size. (The limit isn't guaranteed to be exact,
but it should usually be within a few percent of the actual size.)
Finally, up to eleven backup files are used. The first is has '.000';
the last has '.010'. If all the backup files exist, the oldest is
overwritten.</p>

<p align="left">There's no difference between making a backup
file because the file fills up and because tracing is initialized.
Suppose the tracing system is initialized as above, except that
the file is opened with mode &quot;w&quot; (which forces
overwriting instead of appending). At first, there are no
logfiles in the file system. Then 25 megabytes of log are written.
At that point, there are three logfiles:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
Tracelog.000.txt   # contains the first 10 megabytes
Tracelog.001.txt   # contains the second 10 megabytes
Tracelog.txt       # the current logfile
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">If the server is halted and restarted, there will
be four log files:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
Tracelog.000.txt   # contains the first 10 megabytes
Tracelog.001.txt   # contains the second 10 megabytes
Tracelog.002.txt   # the final part of the first run
Tracelog.txt       # the logfile from the second run
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --> </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left"><a name="tracing_subsystems_independently">Tracing
subsystems independently (topics)</a></h3>

<p align="left">Suppose that you've discovered a bug in the
accounting subsystem of your server. You'd like <strong>verbose</strong>
level messages from that subsystem. From the rest of the system,
you want <strong>warning</strong> or higher level messages to
give your debugging some context, but nothing more detailed. To
be able to control a subsystem's threshold independently, you
must associate it with a particular data structure, called a <em>topic</em>.
Here's how. (See &quot;<a href="examples/topic-example.rb">topic-example.rb</a>&quot;
in the doc/examples subdirectory. )</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file<br>
    accounting_trace = $trace.topic('accounting')</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Topics accept the same level messages you've
already seen:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">accounting_trace.error
    &quot;Impossible event #{event} in state #{state}.&quot;<br>
    accounting_trace.verbose_value { &quot;state&quot; } </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The output looks a bit different than what you've
seen before, because the topic name is included:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">topic-example.rb:10
    at 2001/07/20 00:27:27<br>
    = <strong>accounting</strong> error: Impossible event explode
    in state crashed.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">To set the accounting subsystem's logfile
threshold to <strong>verbose</strong>, you could use either this
method at runtime:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">accounting_trace.set_threshold('file',
    'verbose')</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">or set the environment thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">TRACEENV=&quot;accounting-file-threshold=verbose&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">How, though, is the rest of the system instructed
to set the threshold to <strong>announce</strong>? In one of two
ways. The first way uses a Connector method:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.theme_and_destination_use_default('debugging',
    'file', 'warning')</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">(The meaning of &quot;theme&quot; is defined
later.) The second way uses TRACEENV again:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">TRACEENV=&quot;global-debugging-file-default=warning&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="left"><a name="easy_access_to_topic_objects">Easy
access to topic objects</a></h4>

<p align="left">It's awkward to pass topics around. Here are some
ways to make them widely accessible. (See &quot;<a
href="examples/topic-access-example.rb">topic-access-example.rb</a>&quot;
in the doc/examples subdirectory. )</p>

<p align="left">If the subsystem has a method to itself, it's
convenient to make the trace topic a method constant:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
module Accounting
  <b>Trace = $trace.topic('accounting')</b>
  ...
  Trace.announce 'Accounting subsystem starts; OZ domain.'
  ...
end

</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">Connector#topic</font>
can be called multiple times with the same string. It always
returns the same topic. So each class that makes up a subsystem
can have a class variable that shares a topic object with all the
others:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
class Payroll
  <b>@@trace = $trace.topic('accounting')</b>
  ...
  @@trace.announce 'Payroll shaving pension fund #{shave} fractional percent.'
  ...
end

class Receivables
  <b>@@trace = $trace.topic('accounting')</b>
  ...
end
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Finally, you can install a method on the global
$trace object that returns a specific method:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.topic('accounting')<br>
    <strong>$trace.add_method_for_topic('accounting')<br>
    </strong>...<br>
    $trace.accounting.event 'Starting reconciliation'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">This will fail (with a <font face="Courier New">Trace::Exception</font>)
if the topic name is invalid or already used for some other
purpose. So, while you can create a topic named &quot;hi, mom!&quot;
or &quot;clone&quot;, you can't create methods for them. You can
still retrieve those topics from the Connector indirectly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.topic_with_name('hi,
    mom!').error &quot;It's not true that I never think of you,
    mom.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="left"><a name="connectors_as_topics">Connectors as
topics</a></h4>

<p align="left">A Connector object accepts level messages because
it's a subclass of Topic. It is, specifically, the topic named
the empty string.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
$trace == $trace.topic_with_name('')    -> true
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left"><a name="themes">Themes</a></h3>

<p align="left">Suppose you'd like to use Ruby-trace to record
usage data. You might desire three levels of detail. </p>

<ol>
    <li><p align="left">To allow users to perform the most common
        tasks without a single wasted motion, you might want to
        record each <strong>gesture</strong> they make.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">To know where streamlining is most
        useful, you might record each <strong>feature</strong> a
        user uses. Use of a feature might entail many gestures,
        culminating in the press of an OK or APPLY button in a
        dialog.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Finally, to increase the chance that your
        product's features are what users want, you might try to
        record the <strong>tasks</strong> they're trying to
        perform. A particular task (a use case) would be deduced
        from sequences of dialogs.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p align="left">You could use Ruby-trace's predefined levels (error,
warning, and the like) to record this data, but it would be
confusing and awkward. It would be better to make a clear
distinction between usage data and debugging data. Ruby-trace's <em>themes</em>
do that. A theme is essentially a list of levels, from most
general to most detailed. A Topic can be defined to use a
particular theme's levels, and a Connector can be instructed to
control routing of messages with that theme. Here's how. (See
&quot;<a href="examples/usage-example-1.rb">usage-example-1.rb</a>&quot;
in the doc/examples subdirectory.)</p>

<p align="left">Let's suppose that we're adding usage tracing to
a program that already uses a buffer and logfile for debugging.
We'll reuse those destinations for this new purpose. This is done
in three steps. First, a new theme is added to the Connector:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file {
  add_theme('usage', %w{task feature gesture})
  theme_and_destination_use_default('usage', 'buffer', 'gesture')
  theme_and_destination_use_default('usage', 'file', 'task')
}
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The first line within the block creates the theme.
The next two lines tell the Connector how to handle messages for
topics that have the 'usage' theme. The buffer should receive <strong>gesture</strong>
messages and higher. The log file should receive only <strong>task</strong>
messages; lower level messages will be discarded by default. </p>

<p align="left">The next step is to create a topic:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">topic = $trace.topic('usage',
    <strong>'theme'=&gt;'usage'</strong>)<br>
    $trace.add_method_for_topic(topic.name)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The last step is to scatter appropriate trace
calls throughout the code:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">$trace.usage.feature
    'word count'</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">That will result in a log file with debugging and
usage messages intermixed:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">usage-example-1.rb:11:in
    `initialize' at 2001/07/20 00:02:03<br>
    = announce: User interface starts.<br>
    usage-example-1.rb:15:in `task_completes' at 2001/07/20 00:02:03<br>
    = <strong>usage task</strong>: User has turned off all
    helpful suggestions.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">That mixing may be unsatisfactory. If so, usage
tracing can be sent to a different destination. (See &quot;<a
href="examples/usage-example-2.rb">usage-example-2.rb</a>&quot;
in the doc/examples subdirectory.) That requires editing the code
that creates <font face="Courier New">$trace</font>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><pre>
$trace = Trace::Connector.debugging_buffer_and_file {
  add_theme('usage', %w{task feature gesture})
  <b>add_destination(LogfileDestination.new('usage_file', 'Usagelog.txt'))</b>
  theme_and_destination_use_default('usage', <b>'usage_file'</b>, 'task')
}
</pre><!--webbot
    bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Notice that a default threshold is set only for
messages from topics with theme usage destined for the usage log
file. That's because we never plan to send messages from a usage
topic to the debugging buffer or logfile. </p>

<p align="left">Next, the code that creates the usage topic needs
to be changed:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New">topic = $trace.topic('usage',
    'theme'=&gt;'usage', <strong>'destination'=&gt;'usage_file'</strong>)<br>
    $trace.add_method_for_topic(topic.name)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">None of the calls to trace methods need be
changed. </p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="more_on_control_of_thresholds">More on
control of thresholds</a></h3>

<p align="left">There is a threshold associated with every
destination a topic can send to. This threshold is calculated as
follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p align="left">If the topic has had the threshold
        explicitly set, that's it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Otherwise, if the topic has a default
        threshold, that's used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Otherwise, the &quot;global&quot;
        threshold that applies to all topics is used. </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p align="left">This baroque arrangement allows flexible control.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">If you want more detail across the board,
        you change the global threshold.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">But if you want even more detail about a
        particular topic, you set its default.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Having done that, you may continue
        debugging or running the program until you get to a point
        where you want the ultimate detail. So you set the
        topic's threshold explicitly.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Once you're past that point, you can tell
        the topic to forget the explicit threshold and revert to
        the topic default threshold.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">And you may later tell the topic to
        forget its default threshold and just obey the global
        threshold.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">These three methods control thresholds at runtime:</p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><font face="Courier New">Topic#set_threshold(destination_name,
            level_name)</font></dt>
        <dd>If <font face="Courier New">level_name</font> is
            &quot;none&quot;, no messages flow. If it's &quot;default&quot;,
            any explicit setting of the threshold is forgotten.</dd>
        <dt><font face="Courier New">Topic#set_default_threshold(destination_name,
            level_name)</font></dt>
        <dd>Sets the default threshold. <font face="Courier New">Topic#set_threshold</font>
            takes precedence. <font face="Courier New">level_name</font>
            can be &quot;none&quot;. If it's &quot;default&quot;,
            the topic's default threshold is forgotten, and the
            global default threshold is used instead.</dd>
        <dt><font face="Courier New">Connector#set_theme_and_destination_use_default(theme_name,
            destination_name, level_name)</font></dt>
        <dd>All topics with the given theme have the given
            destination's default threshold set to the given
            level. This has effect only if the topic has no
            explicit nor default threshold. <font
            face="Courier New">level_name</font> can be &quot;none&quot;.</dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Trace environment commands control thresholds at program
launch time. The commands are contained in the value of the
environment variable TRACEENV. They are separated by spaces,
commas, or colons. There are three commands:</p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><em>topic</em>-<em>destination</em>-threshold=<em>level</em></dt>
        <dd>Calls <font face="Courier New">Topic#set_threshold</font>
            on the topic named <em>topic</em>.</dd>
        <dt><em>topic</em>-<em>destination</em>-default=<em>level</em></dt>
        <dd>Calls <font face="Courier New">Topic#set_default_threshold</font>
            on the topic named <em>topic</em>.</dd>
        <dt>global-<em>theme</em>-<em>destination</em>-default=<em>level</em></dt>
        <dd>Calls <font face="Courier New">Connector#set_theme_and_destination_use_default</font></dd>
