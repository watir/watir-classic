embed setup
===========

install the standalone 1.5 control.

Open IE and change security settings to allow the activeX interaction to 
avoid the prompt (maybe, can't get this to work yet...)

@iec.document.all.browser1 will get a pointer to it in the DOM. This is
an object tag thingy:

So, now what?

We can call methods on this control, like navigate, and that works fine.
But calls to .document return the IE DOM's Object document, which is the IE
DOM's document. In other words, 

  ie.document.all.browser1.document == ie.document
  
... because the 2nd document on the left hand side is not being passed on
through into the Mozilla control, but being evaluated against the IE DOM
Object object. There is a GetProperty method in IWebBrowser, but it doesn't
seem to work inside Ruby.
