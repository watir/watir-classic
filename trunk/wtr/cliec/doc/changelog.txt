===Change Log

====2004.227.0
* [Bret] Fixed bug in checkbox wrapper. Thanks to Dan Knierim for the 
  report. 

====2004.054.0
* Newer cl/util/version used to get around syntax bug once the days rolled
  to integers with leading zeros. d'oh!
* Fixed bug in the new options hash that wasn't correctly reading in the
  visible and auto_wrap_form settings.  

====2004.009.0
* Fixed visible and auto_form_wrap assignments from options hash. If the
  options were set to false in the hash, they still showed as true in IEC.
* Added a node.focus call inside the highlight method, to ensure the control
  is scrolled to and made visible. (applies to demo mode)
* Updated google example code to reflect newer IEC features.
* Wrapper for A nodes getting used for SPAN nodes because of a regex that 
  wasn't specific enough. Fixed.
* mozaxc scratch contrib files included in distro
* Updated MoTunes sample app and test/demo files with minor tweaks  

====2004.006.0
* ClIEController.form now has optional param to automatically wrap the DOM
  form instance in an IEDomFormWrapper instance. 
* ClIEController.initialize now takes an options hash to specify, well, 
  options. Two options at this point: visible and auto_wrap_form. This
  method is still backwards compatible -- if you pass in a boolean then
  the visible variable is set and all others ignored.
* Big refactoring/improvements in accessing DOM nodes:
  * IEDomFormWrapper used to have more funky code for wrapping widgets, now
    it's a more flexible plug-in-ish, polymorphing structure, with a 
    separate subclass to wrap every node type (although only some node types
    are supported yet -- see readme.txt). Supporting additional node types 
    will be much easier to add to the code now.
  * There were some limitations because the previous code favored element 
    nodes instead of all nodes on the form. That's been fixed so that text
    nodes are not discriminated against.
  * Special code nonsense for ASP.NET labels has been removed, though should
    still be supported.
  * A new method_missing on ClIEController itself allows very easy access
    to DOM nodes (in and out of forms) that have id/name attributes. 
    [there is still a little screwiness here using this method to talk to
     some form inputs].
     
    If the page has a link with an id like so:
    
      <a href='http://clabs.org' id=clabs>cLabs.org</a>
      
    You can simply call:

      @iec.clabs

    ... to click the link. 

    Buttons with names/ids can be accessed the same way. 

    You can even add your own method_missing to forward calls to your @iec
    instance so your test scripts can look something like this:

      home
      browse
      apples
      add; add;
      checkout

    (unfortunately, assigning values to text inputs, for example, doesn't
     work with this method_missing approach, because Ruby interprets this:
    
       first_name = 'chris'
       
     as a local variable assignment, and it's never passed to 
     method_missing. So it has to again be:
     
       @iec.first_name = 'chris')
       
* WindowsFormWrapper code for use against .NET Windows Forms that have COM
  interop enabled has been removed. This code lives in a file called 
  dotnet.form.rb that's back in the old cLabs scrapware cliecontroller CVS
  repository. 
* Two additional options: :demo_mode and :demo_wait. Calls that fall through
  iec.method_missing use these options (currently, call that fall through
  iec.form.method_missing do not use these, but these two method_missing's
  need to be refactored and merged). If :demo_mode is true, then selected
  nodes will be highlighted (red text, red border) and will sleep for 
  :demo_wait seconds. This is an eye-candy feature for being able to 
  optionally visually follow a test script.
* Added fix for the RPC intermittent bug that would occur of an instance
  of ie/iec was created too soon after a previous one was killed. 
* new submit method calls form.submit. Call to iec.form is with defaults, so
  there's no control for multi-form pages, but it's a convenience method
  anyway.
* new dump_dom method in iec, takes care of using ClIEDomViewer without 
  having to touch it directly. Default output is $stdout, but method accepts
  an io instance.
* minor fix on the Select node wrapper.
* new node wrappers: Header, Italic, Input Text
* license.txt added and all .rb files updated with license in header. 
  License now includes contributor names.
* contrib/motunes added to cvs and to distro.  
       
====2003.362.0
* Builder and Installer working under new RubyForge src tree, etc. Woop.
* waitForIE now sleeps so as not to suck up all CPU time. (thx to Brian
  Candler).
* cl/util/version is now protected so if it doesn't exist the world rolls
  on without -- ain't that important. Thanks to Shashank Date for the bug
  report.
* "Hello world" demo now included in the main file, just run it to see
  things in action. [WHOOPS - took this and moved to example directory...]
* cleaned up the readme.txt some, and included it in the build
* Source re-org and move to RubyForge.net/projects/wtr
* Added mozaxc to cliec/contrib folder with some scripts to help tinker
  around with controlling the mozaxc ActiveX control embedded in a web page.
* Added an example folder with sample code.

====2003.027.0
* No Change Log being kept up to this point. Sorry.
