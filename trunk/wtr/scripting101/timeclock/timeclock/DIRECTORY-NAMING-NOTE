The 'client' and 'server' directories are misnomers. The program has
evolved beyond them. The 'server' code handles persistence. The
client code is a client of the persistence code, but sometimes it's
embedded in a server (an http server). 

I don't have the strength at the moment to deal with CVS and renaming
directories.
