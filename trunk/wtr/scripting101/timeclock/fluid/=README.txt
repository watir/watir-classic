fluid.rb is the source. 

For documentation, read fluid.html. It is generated from
fluid-doc-and-examples.rb, which has a couple of executable examples
as well. (It's generated using the now-outdated 'rdtool'.)

To run the tests, use 'ruby test-fluid.rb'. The other test-*.rb files
are run by it.

The globals subdirectory has some examples of why certain globals
can't be used in Fluid.let.

This code is in the public domain. Thanks for using it.
