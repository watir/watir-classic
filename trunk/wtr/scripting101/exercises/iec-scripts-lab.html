	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 3: Writing Scripts</h2>

	<p>Now that you&#8217;ve used <span class="caps">IRB</span> to drive Internet Explorer, it is time to create a script. Actually, you&#8217;ll create several. Create each script using Scite, the ruby editor. You may wish to try the commands in <span class="caps">IRB</span> first, to make sure they are right.</p>

	<p>There are three ways to run scripts: </p>

	<ol>
	<li>The simplest method is to type F5 while editing the script in
  Scite. This will save the file and then execute it. The output will
  be displayed in a side window. </li>
		<li>A second method is to run a script from the system command
  line. Type &#8220;ruby script-name.rb&#8221; at the <span class="caps">DOS</span> prompt. (Actually, just 
  &#8220;script-name.rb&#8221; usually works too.) This is the most
  reliable method. Use it you are having trouble using F5 in Scite. </li>
		<li>A third method is to load the script into <span class="caps">IRB</span>. Type &#8220;load
  &#8216;script-name.rb&#8217;&#8221; at the <span class="caps">IRB</span> prompt. The advantage of this method is
  that you can interact with the <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller
  after the script has run, using the Watir::IE.attach() method. This 
  gives you a method for debugging your
  scripts.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When you automate tests, you need to be able to repeat tests much more precisely than when you are testing manually. The &#8216;ensure_no_user_data&#8217; method has been specifically provided as a testability feature for timeclock. You may find it useful.</p>

	<p>Create and execute scripts for each of the following procedures. As you  complete each script, demonstrate it to your instructors.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>   <strong>Start The Day.</strong> Log in and navigate to the main time
     clock page, and then start the day. </li>
		<li>   <strong>Start, Stop and Pause.</strong> Start, stop, pause, and
      restart a job. Choose a suitable order for these actions. </li>
		<li>   <strong>Job Switching.</strong> Creates two jobs and then switch
      back and forth between them every few seconds.</li>
	</ol>
