h2=. Lab 4: Verifying Results

You've written some scripts that demonstrate how to automate
an internet browser. But they aren't really tests. Because they don't
really check the results. Now it is time to take care of that.

Refer to the "Watir Cheat Sheet":../doc/Watir-cheat-sheet.doc 
for several testing methods. The "Ruby Cheat Sheet":../doc/Ruby-cheat-sheet.doc 
describes the syntax of an if-then statement in Ruby.

#    *Experimenting with Test Methods.* In IRB, load your "start the day"
     test script and then experiment with different test methods to
     verify whether the test ran correctly. Then update the script so that
     it prints a message indicating whether these methods pass or fail.

#   *Start, Stop, and Verify.* Revise the start, stop and pause test
     script so that it checks the results of each of these actions.

Don't use the assert methods for this lab. We'll use those in the next lab.
