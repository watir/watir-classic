	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 6: Harnessing Tests</h2>

	<p>You&#8217;ve written a number of tests. Now it&#8217;s time to put them all together with a test harness. This will allow them to run in sequence and automatically report whether any of the tests fail.</p>

	<p>The following code demonstrates how to create a simple test harness that loads one test script.</p>

<pre>
  require 'watir'
  require 'test/unit'
  class LoadTestScript &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_login_start
      load 'login-start.rb'
    end
    def teardown
      ie = Watir::IE.attach(:title, /Timeclock/)
      ie.close if ie
    end
  end </pre>

	<p>You can add additional tests, by defining additional methods to the class whose names begin with &#8216;test_&#8217; that load the desired scripts. </p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Test Harness.</strong> Create a test harness that executes all of your test scripts. Each of your scripts should include assertions to verify the test results. If you haven&#8217;t added assertions to them, now is the time.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Bonus Exercises.</strong> If you have time, you may want to try the following:</p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Record Check.</strong> Write another test script. Start with a user that
    has no time records. Record time sessions for two separate jobs,
    one session for each. Verify that two time records appear. </li>
		<li><strong>Test Strategy.</strong> Look over the test ideas you developed in Lab 1.
   Write a test script for one or more of your ideas.</li>
	</ol>
