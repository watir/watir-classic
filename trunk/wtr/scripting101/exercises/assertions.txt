h2=. Lab 5: Assertions

Printing out test results works well when you are automating one test, 
but printing out PASS or FAIL is no longer an effective
testing strategy when running multiple tests. You need
your tests to know for themselves whether they pass or fail. The way
to do this is with assertions. Assertions directly check a value. If
it's as expected, nothing happens. When it isn't, an exception is
raised, which terminates the script. When we add the tests to a harness, 
any test failures will automatically be collected and reported.

Several assertion methods are included in the 
"Watir Cheat Sheet":../doc/Watir-cheat-sheet.doc. 
You may also want to refer to the complete 
"Assertions Library Reference":../doc/Assertions.html.

Update your existing scripts to use assertions.

#    *Start The Day.* Use assertions to verify that the day was started 
     and the background job is running.

#    *Start, Stop and Pause.* Start, stop, pause, and
      restart a job. Use assertions to verify that each action worked
      correctly.
