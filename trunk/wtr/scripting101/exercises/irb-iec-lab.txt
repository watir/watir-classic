h2=. Lab 2: Driving Web Applications using IRB

You have seen a demonstration of how to drive the web application using
Watir and IRB. Now it is your turn. Enter Watir commands into IRB to
drive the Timeclock application. 

Use the "Watir Cheat Sheet":../doc/Watir-cheat-sheet.doc,
"Using IRB and Watir":../doc/Using_IRB_and_Watir_to_Create_Automated_Scripts.doc, and 
the Watir User Guide as references.

We suggest that you execute the following steps:

#   Log into the timeclock server using an existing account.
#   Create a new job.
#   Start the new job.
#   Stop the day.

You will need to have Ruby and the Web Testing with Ruby toolkit
installed on your machine before starting.
