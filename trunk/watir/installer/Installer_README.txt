NSIS Installer for Watir version 1.4

(20/08/2005)

double click the watir_installer.exe and follow the wizard

The installer installs the watir libraries which are mandatory, but then you 
can choose whether to install the documentation, examples and unit tests.

The installer makes a desktop shortcut to the user manual and also some start 
menu entries for the manual and the autoit reference as well as an uninstall 
link.

To uninstall click on the uninstall link from the start menu or from the 
uninstaller created in the Watir directory. 

Everything but the ruby libraries is uninstalled.

Enjoy
