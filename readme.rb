This is Watir - Web Application Testing In Ruby    http://wtr.rubyforge.org

Install Ruby http://ruby-lang.org
   First you need to install Ruby using the one-click installer for Windows. We
   recommend Ruby 1.8.5. (Ruby 1.8.6 has problems.)

   However, if you wish to use Watir's support for the IE showModalDialog then
   you must use Ruby 1.8.2-15 (or 1.8.2-14) and not a more recent version. This
   dialog is the one that is posted with the showModalDialog() JavaScript
   command and is supported with Watir's ie.modal_dialog command.

Install Watir
   Watir is packaged as a gem, a Ruby library that can be installed over the
   internet.

   Watir 1.5 was released in September 2007. To install it, type this at a
   command prompt:
      gem install watir

   Watir 1.4 was released in August 2005. If you are upgrading from it, see
   these notes: http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Development+Builds

How To Use:
   This only works on Windows.
   Requires Internet Explorer 5.5 or newer.
   Check out the mail lists and the documentation for the workarounds.

User Guide:    http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/User+Guide

Unit Tests:
   Run the unittests in a cmd shell. Go to the dir where you installed it and then type 'ruby unittests/core_tests.rb'.
   See the user guide if you are having problems with security blocking.

Typical Usage
   # include the controller 
   require 'watir' 
   # create an instance of the controller 
   ie = Watir::IE.new  
   # go to the page you want to test 
   ie.goto('http://myserver/mypage') 
   # to enter text into a text field - assuming the field is named 'username' 
   ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set('Paul') 
   # if there was a text field that had an id of 'company_ID', you could set it to 'Ruby Co': 
   ie.text_field(:id ,'company_ID').set('Ruby Co') 
   # to click a button that has a caption of 'Cancel' 
   ie.button(:value, 'Cancel').click 

  Identifying something using two or more identifying characteristics
   # Html objects can also be identified via a combination of two of the above methods, 
   # for example to click a span with a class name of 'Label', and whose text is 'Add new', one could say
   ie.span(:class =>'Label', :text => 'Add new').click
   # Or to find one object within another (for example the first text_field within a div of class 
   # 'PasswordInput', where your password equals 'MyPassword'), one could say
   ie.div(:class, 'PasswordInput').text_field(:index, 1).set('MyPassword')
   
  The ways that are available to identify an html object depend upon the object type, but include
   :id           used for an object that has an ID attribute.*
   :name         used for an object that has a name attribute.*
   :value        value of text fields, captions of buttons. 
   :index        finds the nth object of the specified type - eg button(:index , 2) finds the second button. This is 1 based. <br>
   :class        used for an object that has a class attribute.
   :text         used for links and other objects that contain text.
   :xpath        finds the item using xpath query

   * :id and :name are the quickest of these to process, and so should be used when possible to speed up scripts.

  The objects that are currently supported include
   Button
   Radio
   CheckBox
   TextField (Including TextArea and Password)
   Hidden
   SelectList
   Label
   Span
   Div
   P
   Link
   Table 
   Image

 Command line options:

  -b  (background)   Run Internet Explorer invisible
  -f  (fast)         Run tests very fast
  
 Note that if you also use test/unit, you will need to require 'watir' first to avoid conflicts
 with its command line switches.

Javascript Pop Up Support
   Watir now optionally installs AutoIt - http://www.autoitscript.com/
   This is the prefered method for dealing wth pop ups, file requesters etc. Support for Winclickers will be removed.
