== Watir 1.5.5.

New Features
* Multiple attributes can now be specified for these elements:
  li, ul, map, area, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. (This was claimed to work earlier, 
  but never did.)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-196

Bug Fixes

* Statements such at ie.table().row() now work (no longer private). 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-117
* Fixed bug with images method when used with anything but ie. 
  E.g. ie.div().images. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-211
* Fixed intermittent bug with ie.file_field().set.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-210
* When installing Watir 1.5.4 you could get extra, confusing
  questions. This shouldn't happen anymore.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-209
* Improved error message when element is not found using multiple attributes.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-181
* Made examples and unit tests somewhat better examples (removed unnecessary
  "include Watir" statements). http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-159
* Moved brittle unit test that was causing cascading failures.  
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-92
