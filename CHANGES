== Watir 1.5.5.

New Features
* Multiple attributes can now be specified for these elements:
  li, ul, map, area, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. (This was claimed to work earlier, 
  but never did.)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-196

Bug Fixes

* Statements such at ie.table().row() now work (no longer private). 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-117
* Fixed bug with images method when used with anything but ie. (Paul Rogers)
  E.g. ie.div().images. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-211
* Fixed intermittent bug with ie.file_field().set. (Tomislav Car)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-210
* When installing Watir 1.5.4 you could get extra, confusing
  questions. This shouldn't happen anymore.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-209
* Improved error message when element is not found using multiple attributes.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-181
* Made examples and unit tests somewhat better examples: removed unnecessary
  "include Watir" statements; started using "browser" instead of "$ie"; use
  new methods 'goto_page' and 'uses_page' (this last improves performance of 
  unit tests). 
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-159
* Moved brittle unit test that was causing cascading failures; renamed another
  that was causing a namespace collision.
