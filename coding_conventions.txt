In general, Pickaxe is our style manual. Make your code look like theirs. 
The following is mostly elaboration; exceptions are marked as house style.

We use four spaces for each indentation level. (house style)

Don't use braces to span more than one line. Use do/end intead.

Don't use do/end on one line; use braces instead.

We prefer single-quoted strings when string interpolation is not being used. (house style)

Instance variables holding ole objects should have 'ole' in the name. (house style)

In general, Watir names should follow what HTML or JavaScript uses. 
These have precedence over the OLE API names. (house style)

Parameter names should be descriptive and accurate. Always. Same is true for local variables, 
but more slack is allowed.

Single-letter names for local variables are allowed when they have limited scope (and aren't parameters).

No extra whitespace!!! No more than one consecutive blank line. 
Never more than one consecutive space (except indentation).

Argument lists are set like English (one, two, three). 
However: use extra spaces with vertical bars. Thus:
    (1..5).each {| n | puts n}
    
Also, always uses spaces with operators. Thus:
    a = b + c if d == e
    
Capitalization rules -- Straight from Ruby Style:

method names -- lowercase, use underscore between words. always!

instance variables -- same as method names (except with a @). always!

Class names are constants so they must start with Capital (syntax error otherwise).
Use StuddlyCaps for multiple words.

Studdly_Caps_With_Underscores are never, ever, ever correct.

camelCaseWithLowerCaseStart is never, ever, ever correct.
