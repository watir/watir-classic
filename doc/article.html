<h2>Installing Ruby on Windows</h2> 
<p>
Begin by going to <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl" target="_blank">the Ruby One-Click Installer</a> site. Click on the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167" target="_blank">[Downloads]</a> link. You'll see various versions of Ruby available. 
This article was tested with Ruby 1.8.1, which is the version named ruby181-11, dated 2004-01-28. A more recent version should also work, 
though there may be small differences in output. Do not use ruby181-13, it will NOT work well with Watir. There was a bug in a library in that release that Watir relies on.
</p>
<p>The latest release: <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/2407/ruby182-14.exe" target="_blank">1.8.2-14 Final</a> is a good Ruby version to use.</p>
<p>Once it has downloaded, double click on the .exe file to start the installation process. 
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to follow along with the article by using Start > Programs > Ruby 1.8.2-14 > Interactive Ruby Shell. This will start up
<b>IRB</b> which allows you to work with Ruby interactively.
</p>
<h2>Installing Watir</h2> 
<p>This article was written using Watir version 1.0.3. Later versions still support the syntax, but there are some <a href="#changes">minor changes</a>.</p>
<p>Download Watir v. 1.0.3 <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/2594/watir-v1_0_3.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. We recommend following along with the
article using version 1.0.3 at first.</p>
<p>Install:
<ol>
<li>Unzip the file to a temporary folder such as C:\watir_temp</li>
<li>Open a DOS command prompt, and change to that directory</li>
<ul><li>Select Start > Run... type "CMD" in the "Open" field, and click the "OK" button to start a command prompt</li>
<li>Change directories like this: cd C:\watir_temp</li></ul>
<li>Once you are in the temporary directory in your console, type <b>install</b> at the prompt and press Enter</li>
<li>The Watir installer will start up. Check the path it has selected for the "watir_bonus" directory.</li>
<ul><li>This is where the examples, documentation and unit tests are installed.</li></ul>
<li>If you want to change the directory path where "watir_bonus" will be installed, type the letter <b>c</b>, and press Enter.</li>
<ul><li>Type in the full path to where this should be installed with a folder name: ie. C:\watir_bonus</li>
<li>You will also be prompted about shortcuts. Just press Enter at these prompts.</li></ul>
<li>To continue the installation, press Enter. When the installation completes, you will have your DOS prompt back.</li></ol>
<p>Once the installation is complete, change directories to "watir_bonus", and you should see these folders: doc, examples, RDoc, unitTests.
Change directories to the examples folder, and type in <b>articleExample</b> and press Enter. The Google search example in Figure 1 of the article will run.</p>
<p><i><b>*Note:</b></i> If you are using Windows XP with Service Pack 2, see the <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/watir_user_guide.html" target="_blank">User Guide</a> if you are having problems running tests with Watir.
There are instructions in the "Having Problems?" section to deal with security blocking.</p>

</p>
<h2><a name="changes"></a>Changes in Watir</h2>
<p>After release 1.0.3, some changes have been made to improve Watir.</p>
<p>In Watir versions after 1.0.3, to execute <i>ie = IE.new</i>, you must include the Watir module after the
<i>require watir</i> statement in your script like this:<br>
<font face="Courier New">require 'watir'<br>
<b>include Watir</b><br>
ie = IE.new<br></font></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the Watir module inline like this:<br>
<font face="Courier New">require 'watir'<br>
ie = <b>Watir::</b>IE.new<br></font></p>

<b>Other Changes</b>
<p>Watir now uses method names according to Ruby programming standards which means they are in <b>this_case</b> instead of the Java-like <b>camelCase</b>.
The original camelCase methods are still supported, but Watir is now standardizing method names using <b>this_case</b>. For example, the "textField" method can now be called 
like this: <b>text_field</b>.
