<h1>WATIR Example Test Case</h1>
<h2>Google Test Search</h2>
<p>This document walks through a very simple test case: <b>googleSearch.rb</b>.
To begin, from the <b>examples</b> folder in your Watir installation
directory, open the googleSearch.rb file in a text editor. To open it
with SciTE, simply right-click the file in Windows Explorer, and select
<b>Edit</b> from the popup menu.</p>
<p>The format of this example will be to show the Ruby test case
scripting code in a box as you would see it in a text editor, with an
explanation after it.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Open Internet Explorer, and try out the test case manually on your
own:<br>
<b>Steps:</b><br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>go to the Google home page - http://www.google.com </li>
  <li>enter "pickaxe" in the search text field</li>
  <li>click the "Google Search" button</li>
</ol>
<b>Expected Result:</b><br>
- a Google page with results should be shown. "Pragmatic Programmers
LLC" should be high on the list.
<p></p>
<p>Once you have tried the test case out manually, it's time to
automate the test case using Watir. Return to the Google home page
http://www.google.com
and view the page source: right mouse click &gt; View Source. Now you
can follow along and see how to automate this test with Watir based on
the HTML tags in the Google search web application.</p>
<h2>Section 1: Comments</h2>
<p>Test cases should be commented, just as program code should be
commented. In Ruby, any text on a single line that follows a <b>#</b>
is a comment, and is ignored by the Ruby interpreter at run time.</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"><font color="green">
#-------------------------------------------------------------#<br>
# demo test for the WATIR controller<br>
# <br>
# Simple Google test written by Jonathan Kohl 10/10/04 <br>
# Purpose: to demonstrate the following WATIR functionality: <br>
# * entering text into a text field <br>
# * clicking a button<br>
# * checking to see if a page contains text. <br>
# Test will search Google for the "pickaxe" Ruby book<br>
#<br>
#-------------------------------------------------------------#<br>
</font>
</div>
<p>Styles differ with comments, but they can really help with test case
maintenance. In this case, the author has provided their name, a date
and a purpose of the test case. This is here to improve readability,
and to help others who may be using the test understand what it does.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Includes</h2>
<p>To use Watir, or any other library in our test case requires us to
tell the program where to find the library.</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> <font color="green"> #includes:</font><br>
require <font color="purple">'watir'</font><font color="green"> #
the watir controller<br>
<span style="color: black;">include Watir</span><br>
</font></div>
<p>When we run our test script, the Watir library is loaded so that our
test cases can use it.</p>
<h2>Section 3: Declare Variables</h2>
<p>If we are going to use something in our script more than once, or
something that could change, we can declare it as a variable and reuse
it throughout the script. Some objects we can use for testing tend to
change, such as URLs for applications we are testing. In this script,
we assign the test URL as a variable. If it changes, we only have to
change it in one place.
</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample">
<font color="green"> #variables:</font><br>
test_site = <font color="purple">'http://www.google.com'</font>
</div>
<p>The test case author has chosen to assign the URL to a variable
called <b>test_site</b>. It may not be much of an issue in this test
case, but using variables for test URLs is often a good practice. </p>
<h2>Section 4: Open an Internet Explorer Browser</h2>
<p>To begin driving Internet Explorer, we need to tell Watir to open an
instance for testing.</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> <font color="green">#open the IE browser</font><br>
ie = IE.new<br>
</div>
<p>To explain what this is doing, we can start from the right of the
"=" operator. We send a message "new" to the "IE" (Internet Explorer)
class, and assign it to a variable called "ie".
The "ie" variable is a local variable (like "test_site"). This means it
can be accessed from our script, but not from other Ruby functions or
methods.<br>
</p>
<h2>Section 5: Interacting With Google</h2>
<p>Now we are ready to start automating the steps we ran manually using
Watir.</p>
<h3>Beginning the test case</h3>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">"## Beginning of
test: google search"</font><br>
puts <font color="purple">" "</font>
</div>
<p><i>Puts</i> is a reserved word in the Ruby language that tells the
Ruby Interpreter to print whatever comes after it contained in quotes
to the screen.
We could just as easily write this information to a file. These <i>puts</i>
statements are in this test case to make it more self-explanatory. Not
only to they
tell the user what is happening in the test case, they double as
comments. Printing what we are doing when we automate the test case is
useful for debugging when developing
test cases, and for quickly repeating failures for bug reports when the
test case doesn't pass.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Go to the Google site</h3>
<p>This test case follows a pattern of printing out what we intend
Watir to do on a web application, followed by the Watir scripting code
to carry out that action, and finally printing out the action that
Watir just executed. This is a style of test case development that is
useful for tracking down test case
failures quickly.</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">"Step 1: go to the
test site: "</font> + test_site<br>
ie.goto(test_site)<br>
puts <font color="purple">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Action: entered "</font>
+ test_site + <font color="purple">"in the address bar."</font><br>
</div>
<p>The first line uses a <i>puts</i> statement to print out the test
case step we are attempting to the screen. The second line uses the
Watir method "goto" to direct the test
case to the test site: http://www.google.com (stored in the variable <b>test_site</b>).
The third line prints the action that Watir just executed to the
screen.
When we print out the variable, we concatenate it to the string (the
part in quotes) by using the <b>+</b> sign. </p>
<h3>Step 2: Enter Search Term "pickaxe" in the search field</h3>
<p>We need to enter the term to search in the text field on the Google
home page.</p>
<p>What you see in the web browser:</p>
<div class="browserexample">
<input maxlength="256" size="55" name="q" value=""></div>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">"Step 2: enter
'pickaxe' in the search text field"<br>
</font> ie.text_field(:name, <font color="purple">"q"</font>).set(<font
 color="purple">"pickaxe"</font>)<font color="green"> # q is the name
of the search field</font><br>
puts <font color="purple">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Action: entered pickaxe
in the search field"</font><br>
</div>
<p>The first line prints the step we are on to the screen. The second
line enters the text "pickaxe" in the text field named <b>q</b>. The
third line prints what Watir just executed to the screen. The comment
telling the user that "q" is the name of the text field is optional.</p>
<p>This is the tag in the HTML source with the <i>name</i> attribute
we used highlighted:</p>
<div class="htmlexample">
&lt;input maxLength=256 size=55 name=<b>q</b> value=""&gt;</div>
<p>The text field has a <i>name</i> attribute <b>q</b>, so we use
that to tell Watir what object to interact with.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Click the "Google Search" button</h3>
<p>We need to click the search button to activate the Google Search
functionality.</p>
<p>What you see in the web browser:</p>
<div class="browserexample">
<input value="Google Search" name="btnG" type="submit"></div>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">"Step 3: click the
'Google Search' button"<br>
</font> ie.button(:name, <font color="purple">"btnG"</font>).click<font
 color="green"> # "btnG" is the name of the button</font><br>
puts <font color="purple">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Action: clicked the
Google Search button."</font><br>
</div>
<p>The first line prints the step we are on to the screen. The second
line clicks the Google Search button. The third line prints what Watir
just executed to the screen.</p>
<p>This is the tag in the HTML source with the <i>name</i> attribute
we used highlighted:</p>
<div class="htmlexample">
&lt;input type=submit value="Google Search" name=<b>btnG</b>&gt;</div>
<h2>Section 6: Evaluating the Results</h2>
<h3>The Expected Result</h3>
<p>This test case prints out what the Expected Result should be prior
to the test case using Watir to evaluate the results.</p>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">"Expected Result: "</font><br>
puts <font color="purple">" - a Google page with results should be
shown. 'Programming Ruby' should be high on the list."</font>
</div>
<p>These two statements simply print the Expected Result of the test to
the screen.</p>
<h3>Verify Results</h3>
<p>Using Watir and a little Ruby, we can evaluate the results to verify
whether the test case passed or failed.</p>
<div class="testexample">
puts <font color="purple">"Actual Result: Check that the 'Programming
Ruby' link appears on the search results page"<br>
</font><font color="darkblue">if</font> ie.text.include?("<font
 color="purple">Programming Ruby</font>")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; puts <font color="purple">"Test Passed. Found the
test string: Programming Ruby. Actual Results match
Expected Results."</font><br>
<font color="darkblue">else</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts <font color="purple">"Test Failed! Could not
find: Programming Ruby"</font> <br>
<font color="darkblue">end</font><br>
</div>
<p>There is a lot more in this section, but we can break it down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first line prints out the "Actual Result" heading to the
screen.</li>
  <li>The second line gets the text of the page and then calls the "include?" method
	  to determine whether <i>Programming Ruby</i> appears on the
first page.</li>
  <li>Using an <i>if</i> statement, we evaluate whether the
"include?" method was True or False.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If "include?" returns false, the text <i>Programming
Ruby</i> does not appear. The test case fails and we print
the "Test Failed!" message.</li>
    <li>Else, if "include?" returns true (or actually anything
but false), the text <i>Programming
Ruby</i> appears. The test case passes and we
print the "Test Passed." message.</li>
    <li>We close the conditional <i>if</i> section with an <i>end</i>
statement.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>End of Test Case</h3>
<p>What you see in the text editor:</p>
<div class="testexample"> puts <font color="purple">" "</font><br>
puts <font color="purple">"##End of test: Google search"</font><br>
puts <font color="green"># -end of simple Google search test</font>
</div>
<p>The first line prints a blank line for formatting, and a the second
line prints message to the user that the test case has ended. The final
line in green is a comment that shows the end of the test case. </p>
