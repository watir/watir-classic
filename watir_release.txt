Watir Release How To

Check everything out of cvs
-- Do an export. This means you won't get the CVS directories.

in Watir.rb, change the VERSION constant to be the release number

run install
run the unit tests, if they pass, check watir.rb back in
-- Actually the install is unnecessary. The unit tests run against ../watir.rb regardless of what is installed 

tag the files
cvs tag -c -R "new version number" *.*     watir version numbers are like this: v1_8
-- Do this first, before the export. Then you export using the TAG.
-- (Otherwise it is possible someone checks something in between the extract and the tag.)

build the rdoc

delete all the CVS directories
   delete watir\cvs
   then use  dir /s /A:D /b CVS > delcvs.bat
   then edit this file, adding rmdir /s /q at the begining of each line 
   run this batch file
   delete this batch file
-- Not necessary

delete this file!

zip up. Note the filename is watir_v1_1.zip

delete the watir_bonus directories
delete the files in C:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\watir and C:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\watir.rb
-- No longer necessary

unzip and test
-- Again? Why?
