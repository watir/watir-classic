Watir Release How To
TODO: describe how to build the nullsoft installer and the gem.

ZIP-BASED RELEASE

Check everything out of cvs.
In watir.rb, change the VERSION constant to be the new release number.

Update readme.rb with latest release info.
For example, you can use this to get just the logs for revisions 1.94 to 1.119 
  cvs log -r1.94:1.119  watir.rb  

Check in watir.rb and readme.rb.

tag the files (assumes version 1.3.1):
  cvs tag -c -R "v1_3_1" *.* 

In a new directory do an export:
  cvs -z3 -d:ext:pmr16366@rubyforge.org:/var/cvs/wtr export -r "v1_3_1" watir

Build the rdoc:
  build-rdoc.bat

Check to see if any thing needs deleting - this file for example.
Copy readme.rb to readme.txt.

Zip up. Note the filename is watir_v1_3_1.zip.

Note: Don't forget to delete the watir_bonus directories.
